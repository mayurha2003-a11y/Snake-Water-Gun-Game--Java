# Snake-Water-Gun-Game--Java
Developed an interactive command-line Java game where the user plays against the computer using randomization and conditional logic. The user selects Snake 🐍, Water 💧, or Gun 🔫, while the computer randomly generates its choice. The program displays both choices with emojis and announces the final outcome (Win, Lose, or Tie) in bold.
